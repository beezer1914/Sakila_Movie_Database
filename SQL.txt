Question 1 - Query
We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.
Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.


SELECT f.title film_title,
        c.name category_name,
        COUNT (r.inventory_id) rental_count
		
   FROM category AS c
       JOIN film_category fc
        ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
        AND c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')

       JOIN film f
        ON f.film_id = fc.film_id

       JOIN inventory i
        ON f.film_id = i.film_id

       JOIN rental r
        ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
 
 GROUP BY 1,2
 ORDER BY 3 DESC

Question 2- Query:
Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration that all movies are rented for. Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories? Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.

SELECT *,
NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY q2.rental_duration) AS std_quartile
FROM 
	(SELECT f.title film_title,
	 		c.name category_name,
	 		f.rental_duration
	 FROM category c
	 JOIN film_category fc
	 ON c.category_id = fc.category_id	 
JOIN film f
ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
	 
ORDER BY 2,1)q2


Question 3 - Query: 
Finally, provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category. The resulting table should have three columns:

Category
Rental length category
Count

SELECT q3.name,
q3.std_quartile,
COUNT (q3.std_quartile)
FROM( SELECT c.name,
	 f.rental_duration,
	 NTILE(4) OVER(ORDER BY f.rental_duration) AS std_quartile
	FROM category c
	 JOIN film_category fc
	 ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
	 AND c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
	 JOIN film f
	 ON f.film_id = fc.film_id) q3

GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,2


Question 4 - Query:

How well did family movies rent between each store?

SELECT
('Store' || s.store_id) AS store,
DATE_PART('month', r.rental_date) AS rental_month,
DATE_PART('year', r.rental_date) AS rental_year,
c.name,
COUNT (r.inventory_id)
FROM store s
JOIN staff st
ON s.store_id = st.store_id
JOIN rental r
ON st.staff_id = r.staff_id 
JOIN inventory i
ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
JOIN film f
ON  f.film_id = i.film_id
JOIN film_category fc
ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
JOIN category c 
ON fc.category_id = c.category_id
AND c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
GROUP by 2,1,3,4
ORDER BY 2,1 desc
